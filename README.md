I'm [Hayden Hampton](https://haydenhampton.com/), a recent PhD graduate in Big Data Analytics from the University of Central Florida. My research focused on advancing anomaly detection, specifically integrating deep learning with one-class classification techniques. Currently, I'm transitioning my research focus by leveraging this expertise to practical applications in industry.
